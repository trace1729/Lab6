To guide you through implementing the out-of-order issue and execute, but in-order commit, using the **Tomasulo algorithm** approach in the `Simulator.cpp`, I’ve created a **metaprompt** that will help break down the entire process into manageable steps. The **metaprompt** will cover each phase of your pipeline: **Issue**, **Execute**, **WriteBack**, and **Commit**—focusing on data structures like the **Re-Order Buffer (ROB)**, **Reservation Stations (RS)**, and **Register Status Table**.

### **Metaprompt:**

You are implementing an out-of-order issue and execute, but in-order commit pipeline using **Tomasulo's Algorithm**. The goal is to adapt the provided `Simulator.cpp` to manage instructions through four main stages: **Issue**, **Execute**, **WriteBack**, and **Commit**. Each stage involves updating the corresponding data structures, and in particular, you will be working with **Re-Order Buffer (ROB)**, **Reservation Stations (RS)**, and **Register Status Table**.

For each stage, generate detailed prompts to:

1. **Describe the function of each data structure** and how they interact at each stage.
2. **Step-by-step instructions for implementing** each stage in the simulator code.
3. **Debugging and testing strategies** for verifying correct operation at each stage.
4. **How each part of the process integrates** with the existing `Simulator.cpp` structure.

---

### **Stage 1: Issue**

**Objective:**
- In the **Issue Stage**, instructions are fetched, decoded, and entries are allocated in both the **Re-Order Buffer (ROB)** and **Reservation Stations (RS)**.
- For instructions with registers, we need to check their status and assign either **immediate values** or **tags from ROB**.

**Prompts:**

1. **Data Structures Affected**:
   - **ROB**: Allocate a new entry for the instruction.
   - **RS**: Allocate a reservation station for execution.
   - **Register Status Table**: Track the status of registers and link them to ROB entries.

2. **Implementing the Issue Stage**:
   - Fetch the instruction at the current **PC**.
   - Decode the instruction to get **instType**, **rd**, **rs**, and **rt**.
   - Check for any previous **branch** or **jump** instructions and stall if needed.
   - Allocate **ROB** (b) and **RS** (r) entries.
   - For **rs** and **rt** fields, update **RS[r]** based on the **Register Status Table**.
   - If operands are ready, set **Vj** and **Vk**. If not, set **Qj** and **Qk** to hold the corresponding ROB tags.
   - If an instruction has **no operands** (e.g., immediate), directly set **Vj** or **Vk**.

3. **Interface Design for ROB and RS in Issue**:
   - Allocate entries for **ROB** and **RS** and initialize them based on decoded instruction fields.
   - Ensure that the **RS** correctly reflects the instruction type and **ROB** tracks the in-progress instruction for later commit.

4. **Testing**:
   - Test with a mix of **ALU**, **load**, **store**, and **branch** instructions.
   - Verify if **ROB** and **RS** are correctly updated for each instruction type.

### **Stage 2: Execute**

**Objective:**
- The **Execute Stage** runs instructions that are ready. This involves checking whether the operands are available and dispatching to functional units for execution.
- For **arithmetic instructions**, **load/store instructions**, and **branches**, ensure that operations are dispatched to the correct functional units.

**Prompts:**

1. **Data Structures Affected**:
   - **RS**: Track the readiness of operands and ensure that the appropriate functional units are available.
   - **Functional Units (FUs)**: Dispatch instructions to ALU, MUL, or MEM units based on the instruction type.

2. **Implementing the Execute Stage**:
   - Iterate through the **RS** table and check if both operands (`Vj`, `Vk`) are available.
   - If **Qj** and **Qk** are cleared, begin computation for arithmetic and logic instructions.
   - For **loads**, compute the effective address and initiate memory access.
   - For **stores**, check if operands are ready and initiate memory write.

3. **Handling Functional Units**:
   - Implement the logic to dispatch instructions to the **ALU**, **MUL**, and **MEM** units.
   - Track the availability of functional units (e.g., we have 4 ALUs, 1 memory unit, and 4 MUL units).
   - Introduce latency for **MUL** (4 cycles) and other instruction types (1 cycle for ALU and MEM).

4. **Testing**:
   - Test for simultaneous execution of multiple arithmetic instructions.
   - Ensure correct dispatch of **store** and **load** operations to memory.
   - Track the status of the **Functional Units** and validate proper execution.

### **Stage 3: WriteBack**

**Objective:**
- In the **WriteBack Stage**, results of completed instructions are written back to the **ROB** and **RS**.
- Update the **RS** and **ROB** when an instruction finishes execution.

**Prompts:**

1. **Data Structures Affected**:
   - **RS**: Clear `Busy` flag and update results for instructions that have finished executing.
   - **ROB**: Set `Ready` and update the `Value` field of the ROB entry.

2. **Implementing the WriteBack Stage**:
   - Iterate through the **RS** table and identify instructions that have completed.
   - Update corresponding **ROB** entry with the result and mark the instruction as **Ready**.
   - Clear the **Busy** flag in the **RS**.
   - Update **RS** and **ROB** when operands are forwarded (from other instructions in the pipeline).

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify that **ROB** and **RS** are updated correctly after execution.
   - Check if **WriteBack** clears the **Busy** flags in the **RS** and updates the correct **ROB** entries.

---

### **Stage 4: Commit**

**Objective:**
- The **Commit Stage** writes the final results to the **register file** or memory and frees the **ROB** entry.
- Only instructions that have passed all previous stages (out-of-order execution) will be committed in **program order**.

**Prompts:**

1. **Data Structures Affected**:
   - **ROB**: Commit the result of the instruction (write to register or memory) and mark the entry as **not busy**.
   - **Register Status Table**: Clear the **busy** flag for the register once the instruction commits.

2. **Implementing the Commit Stage**:
   - Fetch the instruction at the **head of the ROB** (i.e., the instruction that is ready to commit).
   - If it is a **store**, write the value to memory. If it is an **arithmetic instruction**, write the result to the register file.
   - Update **ROB** and **Register Status Table** accordingly.

3. **Testing**:
   - Verify that **commit** happens in program order (even for out-of-order instructions).
   - Ensure that **registers** and **memory** are updated correctly after commit.

---

### **General Testing Strategy:**
1. Create **test cases** with a mix of instructions, including:
   - **Load**, **Store**, **ALU**, **MUL**, **Branch** instructions.
2. Ensure **out-of-order execution** for instructions with available operands, but **in-order commit** (i.e., commit instructions in the order they were issued).
3. Validate that **ROB**, **RS**, and **Register Status Table** are properly updated and cleared.

This **metaprompt** will help guide you through each step of implementing **Tomasulo’s Algorithm** in your `Simulator.cpp`. Each stage is broken down with its associated data structures, and you will be guided on how to update these structures as well as the interactions between them.

Let me know if you need any additional clarifications or specific examples!



Based On the tomasolu class interface and issue stage you generated above, and the simulator.cpp I upload eariler, help me implement issue stage.
